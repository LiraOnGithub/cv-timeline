	% \timeline consists of two parts: the timeline items and connecting them.
	% There are three items in the timeline:
	%	- \historyItem: contains the mayor items. Arguments are: name, icon, title, date and content
	%	- \historySubItem: same as \historyItem, but indented. They are part of a \historyItem
	%	- \historySeperator: used to separate \historyItems.
	% The content of \historyItem and \historySubItem may contain a \begin{details}...\end{details}.
	% The \detailItems within details work the same way as the \profileItems in the profile part.
